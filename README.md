Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design

In this course, the problems we were solving related to the pros and cons of different database structures.
While each structure has its merits, depending on the state of the raw data, some structures have very clear advantages over others.
For example, in data that in already sorted, a hash table or vector would support easy database lookups, but a binary search tree
would be at a severe disadvantage as the tree expands into a huge unbalanced structure.

I used the references in zybooks to understand the basics of how the different structures were formed, then used several websites
to explore the advantages, disadvantages, and average runtimes of each structure.  Understanding each structure is important for ensuring
that a database remains manageable with a acceptable runtime for calling data.

Searching stackoverflow for advice and issue resolution was helpful in overcoming the roadblocks I encountered.  Sometimes the best thing to
do though was to step away and come back a different time. After staring at a computer all day for work, coming home to stare at a different
computer was sometimes not a realistic strategy to finish each project.

Working on this final project has shown me how to use a database structure to my advantage.  While most use cases at SNHU don't actually
require an ideal database due to the size of the database we work with, using those best practices now and choosing to take advantage of
database structures will help me in the future.

One of the most useful skills I improved in this course was making readable code and comments that explained very simply what each portion did.
Addtionally, using recursive functions helped me make my code more maintainable and adaptable, and was helpful in finishing my final project.
